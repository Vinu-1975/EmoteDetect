# EmoteDetect

## Overview
EmoteDetect is an Android application developed as part of the Mobile Application Development Course at Amrita School of Computing. This app leverages advanced deep learning models to accurately detect facial emotions from images, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time emotion analysis.

## Features
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to analyze and detect emotions in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate interface, designed specifically for seamless user interaction.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs the CKPLUS dataset, known for its robustness and precision in facial emotion classification.

## Dataset
The app uses the [CKPLUS dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawon10/ckplusf), which is a well-known source for facial emotion recognition tasks. This dataset includes labeled facial expressions that enhance the model's ability to accurately predict emotions.
